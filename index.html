      <h3>I was wondering HOW exactly can I show you ALL about myself in one page🤔</h3>
      <p>I mean, one side of A4 is soooooo limiting😭</p>
      <p>But what if it wasn't on paper🧐</p>
      <p>So here it is. A literal <em><STRONG>PAGE</STRONG></em> about me (I learnt how to code just for you guys😉)</p>
      <p>ENJOY🥰</p>
     <hr size="4" color="Red" />

  <p>In terms of what I've done in Thamesmead. Let's just say I've done <em><strong>A LOT</strong></em>😅 </p>
  <p>I've always been told that curiosity killed the cat, but no one told me it died doing what it loved.
    I was always the shy and curious person. The listener, the supporter, but never the main character😔.
    I loved learning different things and my curiosity took me to places
    I never had the confidence to go alone, and that’s how I ended up living my best life in Thamesmead😎</p>
  <p>Here's a little snippet &#129303;</p>

       width= '100%'
       height= '50%'
       alt="Email me if you can't see it and I'll send it to you :)" >
  <p>As you can see, I've done some things, a lot of them as voluntary roles
    (and many more that I just couldn't fit in!😓) and this is was all over the course of <em><strong>A YEAR🥳</strong></em></p>
  <p>What can I say, I am ONE with the force of Thamesmead</p>

         height= 15%
         alt="Email me if you can't see it and I'll send it to you :)">
  <p>I've done everything ranging from art installations in the Thamesmead festival,
     writing my one and ONLY song😇, some spoken word, to even being featured on our very own Thamesmead radio and youtube channel,
     menotirng aspiring sound artists, multiple film shoots and many more that I can hopefully delve into
     in the interview </p>
  <p>Honestly, at this point, you name it, <strong>I've done it</strong>😅 in some sort of way including, acting
      , directing, social media marketing and SOOOOOO much more </p>
   <hr size="4" color="Red" />

<p>Of course I'm guessing you'll want to hear those songs and spoken word right &#129303;</p>

<h3>Many people ask HOW do I find the time to do all this🤯</h3>

<p>My answer will ALWAYS be: If something's important to you, you make time for it💁</p>

<p>I <em><strong>LOVE</strong></em> meeting new people and leanring different things
   and this is eveident from the differnet voluntary roles I've had ranging from
   a home for convicts detained under the Mental Health Act to even the Euros
   (both were VERY intresting experiences)</p>
<p>But Thamesmead has always been where I've given back the most. It really is
   The Land of Opportunity (sorry New York...😬)</p>
   
<p>So yes curiosity did kill the cat💀, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t die happy
  and with a big grin on its face😸. I believe that curiosity can teach you the
  best lessons and provide you with the most unexpected opportunities.
  So I have a lot of big dreams like winning a Nobel Prize and putting Thamesmead on the map
  because someone once told me: 'When you shoot for the sky, even if you don't land on the moon,
  you'll be amongst the stars'.
